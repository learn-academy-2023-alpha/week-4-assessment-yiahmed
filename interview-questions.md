# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object oriented programming is a system that is based idea that objects contain blocks/lines of code and can operate and access the code within them. It is different from functional programming because functional programming prioritizes the use of functions and bases its logic around them will object oriented programming does the same but with objects instead. Some advantages to functional programming is that it can be easier to read and understand than OOP.

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the organization of code into small, reusable units, called classes, that define the behavior of objects.The main difference between OOP and functional programming is their approach to state and behavior. In OOP, objects encapsulate state and behavior together, while in functional programming, state is typically immutable and behavior is defined by functions that take in and return values.

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: The difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby is that a Float is a number with a decimal point while an Integer is a whole number. 

Researched answer: In Ruby, a Float is a number with a decimal point, while an Integer is a whole number without a decimal point. Floats have a greater range and precision than Integers. They can represent a wider range of values, including values with decimal places, while Integers are limited to representing whole numbers within a certain range.

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return means that a method in Ruby will automatically return the last line of code in that method. I came across this during my time coding and upon during research I ran into this term implicit return. My understanding is that this replaces the need for a return statement, but without knowing this a developer can run into a road block and not know why only their last line is being returned.

Researched answer: In Ruby, an implicit return refers to the fact that a method will automatically return the result of the last expression evaluated, without the need for an explicit return statement.This can make code more concise and readable, since you don't need to clutter your code with unnecessary return statements.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A Ruby block is similar to a higher order function in JavaScript where a method can use the block as an argument. For example the map method can be called on an array and using {} to hold the ||(PIPES‼️) which will contain the parameter of the block. The logic will go after the ||(PIPES‼️) and it can be preformed as map iterates through the array.

Researched answer: In Ruby, a block is a piece of code that can be passed to a method as an argument. It is a way of encapsulating a set of instructions that can be executed by the method. Blocks are a powerful feature of Ruby that allow for flexible and expressive code.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: To extract a value from a Ruby hash you can use the [] and within them you can input the name of the key within the hash that contains that value you want to extract.

Researched answer: In Ruby, you can extract a value from a hash by using the key associated with the value. There are a few ways to do this: using the bracket notation, using the fetch method, and using the values_at method.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: Class inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where a class is created by inheriting properties and methods from another class (known as the superclass or base class).

2. RSpec: RSpec is a testing framework for Ruby that is used to write automated tests for Ruby applications. RSpec provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing tests that is designed to be easy to read and write, and that emphasizes the behavior of the code being tested.

3. CRUD: CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a set of basic operations that are commonly used in computer programming and database management to manipulate data.

4. Test-driven development: Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach that involves writing automated tests for a piece of code before writing the code itself.

5. HTTP: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for communication between web servers and web clients (such as web browsers). It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
